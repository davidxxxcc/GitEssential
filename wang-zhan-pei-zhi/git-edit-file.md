This chapter shows how to edit and commit file on Git

Let's say we have three different files and now we make some text change on these files.

![](/assets/file)

Check working place status

`git status`

![](/assets/checkStatus)

Now you can see three files are marked with red and not stage for commit

Let stage all the files

`git add .`

Or if you want to stage specified file you can

`git add first_file.text`

In this case, we stage all of the files

![](/assets/stageAll)
